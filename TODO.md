- Use https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2
- Introduce https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context
   - Associate context data with context e.g. trace-id.
- Check https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/trace
- Refactor transport/Protocol
   - think about performance
   - get rid of idea of receive returns a channel since this
     serialization will make it slow
   - don't plug transport in protocol instead make protocol statless
- Fix remote errors
   - Introduce something like nano.Error(code, msg)
   - Figure out how to fix equality operator for errors in client side
     (reflect.DeepEqual!)
- Rethink the idea of ``Params["_0"]``
   - Introduce something like Request, Response structs?
   - Think how protocol can interact with those? de/serialization?
- https://godoc.org/github.com/tylerb/graceful
- Don't name command line "nano" (should be obvious why)
- client mock (register/replay/check)
- Support request cancelation
   - different transports may support it or not
   - Think how rabbitmq should support it.
- one way messages (ala thrift)
- Kubernetes and go-nano
